# gradle-plugin-jflex

A Gradle plugin for [JFlex](http://jflex.de)

## Usage

    plugins {
       id "org.xbib.gradle.plugin.jflex" version "1.4.0"
    }

Gradle will look for your JFlex files in the source sets you specified.
By default, it looks with the pattern `**/*.jflex` under `src/main/jflex`
and `src/test/jflex`.

You can set up the source sets like this:

    sourceSets {
      main {
         jflex {
           srcDir "src/main/jflex"
         }
         java {
           srcDir "$buildDir/my-generated-sources/jflex"
         }
      }
    }
    
The lastJava `srcDir` definition will be used as the base for the JFLex target path.
If not given, the JFlex target path for generated Java source follows the pattern:

`${project.buildDir}/generated/sources/jflex`

The JFlex target path will be added automatically to the java compile task source directory 
of the source set.

## Parameter support

The following parameters can be set in a global `jflex` extension 
in the gradle script. See also https://jflex.de/manual.html

| Name    | Description |
| ------- | ---------- |
| encoding | the file encoding |
| rootDirectory | the root directory used by JFlex (modification discouraged since the directories are derived from gradle source set)
| skel | uses external skeleton <file> in UTF-8 encoding. This is mainly for JFlex maintenance and special low level customisations. Use only when you know what you are doing! JFlex comes with a skeleton file in the src directory that reflects exactly the internal, pre-compiled skeleton and can be used with the skel option. |
| verbose | display generation progress messages (disabled by default) |
| jlex | tries even harder to comply to JLex interpretation of specs |
| no_minimize | skip the DFA minimisation step during scanner generation |
| no_backup | don't write backup files if this is true |
| unused_warning | warn about unused macros (by default false) |
| progress |  progress dots will be printed (by default false) |
| dot | If true, jflex will write graphviz .dot files for generated automata (by default, false) |
| time | If true, jflex will print time statistics about the generation process (by default false) |
| dump | If true, you will be flooded with information, e.g. dfa tables (by default, false) |
| legacy_dot | dot (.) meta character matches [^\n] instead of [^\n\r\u000B\u000C\u0085\u2028\u2029] |
| statistics | print output statistics (by default, false) |
